Speech-to-Text & Translation App
This project is a Python-based Speech-to-Text and Translation application that allows users to convert spoken words into text and translate them into multiple languages. The application features a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, making it user-friendly and accessible for various use cases.

🚀 Features
✔️ Converts speech into text using the Google Speech Recognition API.
✔️ Translates the recognized text into multiple languages using the Deep Translator library.
✔️ Saves both original and translated text into a file for future reference.
✔️ Simple and interactive GUI built with Tkinter for easy use.

🛠 Technologies Used
Python 3.13.1
SpeechRecognition (for converting speech to text)
Deep-Translator (for translating text into different languages)
Tkinter (for the graphical interface)
📌 How It Works
1️⃣ The user clicks the "Start" button in the GUI.
2️⃣ The application listens to the user’s voice and converts it into text.
3️⃣ The text is automatically translated into the selected language.
4️⃣ Both original and translated text are displayed on the screen and saved in a text file.

💡 Future Enhancements
Add text-to-speech (TTS) for reading out the translated text.
Implement support for multiple translations in a single session.
Provide an option to choose different speech recognition engines.
